# Thunder

[Link to Project](https://www.github.com/RohanNagar/thunder)

Thunder is a REST API that interfaces with a DynamoDB database to provide an easy way to create, update, fetch, and delete users.
Thunder was built as part of the backend for Pilot, but is currently being enchanced to become generic.
Soon, Thunder can serve as the user backend for any project and will be fully customizable.
