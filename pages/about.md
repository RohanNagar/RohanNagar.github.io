The wonderful thing about the internet is that people like me can share ideas freely. This would not have been possible
20 years ago, but now anyone has a platform to make themselves known. To define their beliefs, to market their products,
to share information.

Despite the turmoil and stresses in the world, it's an incredible time we live in. I want to explore more of that here. Some
of my stories may be rants. Some may be political. It's hard for me to say what I really want this space to be. I'm going
to write about tech, programming, life, Microsoft, gaming, politics, music... yeah, I don't think this will be very
well contained. What I do know is that I just want to get my ideas out there. Even if nobody ever reads these lines,
the fact that my ideas are available for anyone to read is such a miracle.

I guess I should also talk about myself here. I'm a Software Engineer working at Microsoft. I graduated from The University
of Texas at Austin in May 2017, and joined Microsoft in July 2017. Profesionally, I am passionate about engineering, design,
and project management. I have a beautiful girlfriend who is a personal trainier and is getting her way in to the marketing
industry. I also very much enjoy gaming, music, cycling, and televison.
