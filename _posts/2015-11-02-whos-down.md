The latest app from Google seems to be a hot topic in my circles lately. I've managed to get one of those "exclusive" invites to [Who's Down](https://whosdown.com). Who's Down is an app that markets itself as the easy way to see which friends are available to hang out. I've been using Who's Down for about a day now, and thought I'd throw in my two cents about it.

Who's Down is another one of Google's invite-only product releases. They've been doing this for quite a while now, with Gmail, Inbox, and even Google Glass. I'm assuming that they do this to do some trial runs before breaking the bank on infrastructure for a new product. However, in my opinion this can doom many of their products from the start. People are eager to try something out when it is *new* and exciting. These invite walls limit the number of people who will get use the product when it's hot off the press, and this slow growth quite tremendously. In the case of Who's Down, an app that relies heavily on having a large amount of friends use the app too, this could spell its failure.

I received my invite from a fellow UT student giving them out on Facebook. Eager to try it out, I installed it and signed in with my Google account. I was then prompted to enter my invite code, as well as verify my phone number. I'm assuming that the phone number is way for Who's Down to connect you with your friends more easily. I gave Who's Down permissions to send push notifications and to access my contacts, as those seemed to be quite important for the app to function well.

After all the initial set-up, which took a little longer than I expected, I was in! The app itself is fairly basic. When the app launches, you're greeted with a white screen saying "Who's Down" and a single switch. You simply flip the switch in order to be "down" to meet up with friends. This will send a push notification to all of your friends, letting them know that you are available. From there, you can see which of your other friends are also down at the moment. Tapping on their name will initiate a conversation, and you can discuss any plans that you want to make.

And for the most part, that's it. You can also change what you're down to do when you flip your switch. By default, it says that you're "down to do anything", but you can change this to any text you want. Adding friends is easy, and you can even send anyone on your contacts list an invite code so that they can try it out with you.

I've only been using the app for about a day now, but I can really see the potential. It's *so easy* to let everyone know that you want to do something - just open the app and flip a switch. This definitely beats trying to organize all your friends together into a group chat on GroupMe or Messenger. Plus, you don't have to ask someone if they want to go - you'll already know if they're down or not. It makes eating out a lot quicker: ask who's down to get tacos and you're well on your way to some delicious Mexican food.

One thing I noticed after getting some of my friends an invite is that the notifications seem a little buggy. I'm not entirely sure if everyone on your friends list receives a notification when you flip the switch or not, it's never made clear. It would be nice if you could customize your notification settings, maybe to turn off notifications at certain times of the day that you know you'll always be busy. Small things like that could really make the app feel complete.

The biggest problem right now is the lack of users. This is the type of app that will only work if a large number of your friends are using it, and it goes back to the invite-only problem I was talking about earlier. When you only have 4 or 5 friends on the app, it actually is a little more frustrating to communicate via Who's Down rather than simple text or Messenger. The app needs more exposure, but if you have 50+ friends using the app, it can be a much easier way to find people to spend time with and organize your plans.

Who's Down is something that I could really get used to using. It's quick and easy to let people know you're available and to see if anyone else is too. If it can gain enough popularity, it could become *the* tool for impromptu trips to the lake or the donut shop.
